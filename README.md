# Just C please

This branch features the C code Me & Matt Lonto have been working on in the past couple of labs before this final. We adapted it for the 7 segment display we were using for our final project. It gets uploaded straight to the arduino and does not require any middleware. We tried to keep it as simple and concise as possible. 

# Setup

To use all you have to do is follow the [hardware hookup](https://github.com/CrypticSquirrel/SevSegDisplayClock/blob/master/documentation/Report.md) guide on our report markdown document. Open up this code in your Arduino IDE and just upload it straight to the board.
