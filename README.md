# Arduino Clock Web Interface

This repository houses the codebase for Edward Breja & Matt Lonto's Microprocessor Systems final project. Our project features an interactive website that provides you with a live preview of time past, time remaining, or current time in an elegant Seven Segment Digit style. Our interactive application will interface with an arduino's hooked up seven segment display through a Node.js (Express, Johnny-Five) server. To get started, read our documentation!

If you like visuals, you can check out our [demo site](https://crypticsquirrel.github.io/SevSegDisplayClock/) hosted here using github pages. This only demonstrates the front end aspect of this project.

The [developer documentation](https://github.com/CrypticSquirrel/SevSegDisplayClock/blob/develop/documentation/DeveloperDocumentation.md) has some setup instructions and code explanation.

Our [final report](https://github.com/CrypticSquirrel/SevSegDisplayClock/blob/develop/documentation/Report.md) has a good high level description of what's going on. It is written in a loose lab report format for the ENGR 385 class at Andrews University.
