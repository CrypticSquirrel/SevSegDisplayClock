# Project Setup

This project uses Node and Express. Clone it and run `npm install` in the root repository. If you do not have node yet, read the [node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) first.

# Hardware Setup

See [Report.md](https://github.com/CrypticSquirrel/SevSegDisplayClock/blob/develop/documentation/Report.md) for wiring and pin information. 

Upload the firmata protocol to your arduino board. See [documentation here](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Installing-Standard-Firmata/) on how to do that if you are unsure.
